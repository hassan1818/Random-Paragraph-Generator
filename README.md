# Random-Paragraph-Generator
The Random Paragraph Generator is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that generates random paragraphs of text. Users can select a number from 1 to 9 to specify how many paragraphs they want to generate. If no number is entered, the application generates a single paragraph by default.
